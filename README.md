iTunesMapper
========

NO WORKING CODE HERE.

The goal is to import itunes XML file and google location data to produce a map of where you listened to what.

Planning to leverage liamks/pyitunes to get data from iTunes

Planning to acquire the users personal location data from Google. Not sure if Google makes this easy.

Planning to create a geoJSON file and use GitHub to display results. See: https://github.com/keum/data_display/blob/master/cso_test_file.geojson
